            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

And we ought to be the more attentiue herein: for that of his owne experience he founde, and tryed his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour to be of proofe, and ſuch as coulde not be pierced. Beſides that he was not onlie a Prophete, but alſo a Prince, and King, inferior to none in temporall bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayles: For his Ancient once diſplayed in the fielde, he neuer turned his backe, or gaue grounde vnto the enimie: Hee forſawe daungers, had a preſent minde in perylles: hee was fierce in fight, and mercifull in victorie. And in all theſe thinges it was his chiefe prayſe, that he fought <hi>Bella domini, The Lords warres.</hi> But as hee was notable that waye, ſo was he an Artificer (and as they ſay) his
<pb facs="tcp:3469:82"/> Craftſemaiſter, in ſpirituall warfare: wherein he ſuſteyned ſo many tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and aſſaultes of ſathan, and ſo of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten caryed away victorie through Gods aſſiſtaunce: that next after <hi>Iob,</hi> I maye place him the ſeconde Captaine vnder Chriſtes banner. And albeit there maye at the firſt ſight, ſéeme to be ſome diuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitie betwéene the holy Apoſtle, and him touching their Armour and weapons: Yet wee muſt remember the occaſion thereof, to bee the ſundrie ſleyghtes and <note place="margin" type="runSum">The cauſe of ſome diſſimili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene Paule and Dauids Armour.</note> craftie pollicies of ſathan, rather then the diſſenting mindes of theſe ſpirituall warriours. For the deuyll vſeth not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes one kind of weapon, &amp; maner of warre: but hath his dayly deuiſes to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uade the faithful: he muſt therfore be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countred lykewiſe w<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſtore of weapons, and varietie of armour, if we meane to gette the victorie. In olde time the black Byll, and Bowe, bare the price in bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayles: but nowe the Gonne and Pyke, are better lyked. Theſe two Captaines therfore are no more blame worthie, in furniſhing Chriſtes ſeruitors with ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiencie of Artyllarie: then a temporall Prince, who opening his Armorie, wyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth

That the Apoſtle kindleſh mans induſtrie, the Prophete calleth to our remembraunces Gods prouidencie, the Apoſtle calleth for the labour &amp; work of man, the Prophet encourageth the ſame in the power of God, the Apoſtle ſheweth how the Lorde bleſſeth the tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uailes of his Childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in mercy, the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phete openeth howe God tryumpheth ouer his enimies in his myghtye ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſtie.</p>

For the Churche doeth not perfitlie ſee God in this lyfe, neyther enioyeth the glorie promyſed: but ſtandeth yet vpon the Rock Chriſt, by fayth, and being in the cleft of the Rocke, ſubiect to perſecution, looketh and awayteth for glorie, whyles God paſſeth, euen when the Church is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumate and finiſhed. For after this <note place="margin" type="runSum">The backe partes are Gods word.</note> paſſage, there is eternall glorie, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in wee ſhall beholde God perfitlie, and as hee is. Whereas nowe we onelie ſee his backe partes. But I omitte the deepe myſteries of this peece of ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. I onelie propoſe the ſtorie to bee conſidered of my godly Reader: that he might obſerue howe this ſentence ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth all times, of the Church to the ende he may reape ſuch effectuall conſolati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, that hell gates ſhall not preuayle againſt him. We ought to know ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the Church ſhal co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinue alwayes amongſt the raginge ſtormes and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſts
<pb facs="tcp:3469:104"/> of the world, and that by the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uailous, and mighty protection of God, whyles God paſſeth by, euen vntyll the tyme of glorifycation.</p>
            <p>Surelie the Church of God in theſe <note place="margin" type="runSum">The face of the Church in theſe dayes.</note> latter tymes, wandereth as it were in the wylderneſſe, almoſt without any certaine ſeate, or defence: ſauing it hath his <hi>Halcions dayes,</hi> preſenteth in this Ilande. In the meane ſeaſon, as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the people of Iſraell, a great multitude forſooke God, and ſo fell into Gods wrath and vengeaunce: euen ſo nowe a dayes, we maye beholde Kings and Princes, and a great multitude to contempne the goſpell, and ſo to procure vnto them ſelues euerlaſting maladicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and deſtruction. On the other ſyde that lyttle flocke, which profeſſeth the goſpell, to bee depriued of all humaine helpe, &amp; to wraffle daylye with miſeries and callamities. But let vs beholde the Image, propoſed in the hyſtories of the Iſraelytes: and aſſure our ſelues, that although the Church, ſeeme nowe to bee as an exyle and baniſhed perſon vpon earth: yet that it is couered, with Gods hande, and with a heauenlie pyller of
<pb facs="tcp:3469:104"/> fire, and that Chriſt her captaine, is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent with her. Who wyll as the Pſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſt ſayth: <hi>Appeare to be a God in Sion.</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Pſa. 84.</note> For albeit God appeareth &amp; ſheweth his preſence throughout the rounde worlde <note place="margin" type="runSum">Gods ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence and apperaunce in the Church.</note> by his prouidence, regiment and conſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation of all things: yet he manifeſt his preſence in the Church by more peculy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ar and ſpeciall meanes: Namelie by preſeruing and maintayning the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterie and ſacramentes, by his dwelling in the Saintes through fayth, by his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall conſolation in the holy Martyrs: and to conclude, in defending his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation myraculouſlie, againſt the raging furors of diuelles &amp; worldlings. Whereof <hi>Moiſes</hi> ſpeaketh thus. <hi>They haue heard that thou Lorde, art amongſt</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Numb. 14.</note> 
               <hi>this people, and that thou art ſeene face to face.</hi> And <hi>Ioſua: You shall knowe that the Lorde God is in the middle of</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Ioſu. 3.</note> 
               <hi>you.</hi> And againe: <hi>That all the inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taunts of the earth maye know that God</hi>

            </p>
            <p>This preſence and protection of God <note place="margin" type="runSum">Two vſe of this doctrine.</note> ouer his Church, hath two endes: wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the one appertayneth to ſuch as are without, and as yet prophane perſons:
<pb facs="tcp:3469:105"/> the other, vnto thoſe that be of the hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſholde of fayth, and Cittie of God. And as touching the vngodlie, this is the ende of Gods preſence in the Church: that they either conioyne them vnto the congregation of the faithfull, through <note place="margin" type="runSum">Gods pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence a witnes and Iudge againſt the vngodly.</note> true repentance, renouncing a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

               </gap> impie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie and wickedneſſe: or elſe being obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, maye haue their owne conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, as wytneſſes of their iuſt condemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation. For it ſhall come to paſſe, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to that ſentence of the Pſalme. <hi>All mine enimies shalbe confounded, and</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Pſa. 6.</note> 
               <hi>ſore vexed, they shalbe turned backe, and put to shame ſodainlie.</hi> And againe: <hi>God shall deſtroy thee for euer, he shall take thee, and plucke thee out of thy ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle, and roote thee out of the lande of the liuing. The righteous alſo shall ſee it, and shall feare, and shall laugh at him ſaying: Behold the man that tooke not God for his ſtrength, but truſted vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Pſa. 52.</note> 
               <hi>the multitude of his ritches, and put his ſtrength in his malice. &amp;c.</hi> There can therefore be no greater plague then by ſinne, to be ſeparated from God, to bee turned from the fountaine of all good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, vnto the bothomleſſe lake of all
<pb facs="tcp:3469:105"/> euyll, from ſweete lyfe, to bytter death, from true bleſſedneſſe, to euerlaſting miſerie.</p>
            <p>On the other ſide as touching the elect <note place="margin" type="runSum">A confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the godly.</note> and faythfull, this is the effect and end, of Gods preſence in his Church. To confyrme them in fayth, to moue them to be thankefull towarde him, vnder whoſe wings they are couered, to make them feare God, in whoſe fighte they walke: that they ſhould alſo in tyme of trouble cal vpon him being preſent with them: that in patience they ſhould looke for victorie agaynſt worlde and diuell. Hereof ſpryng thoſe ſayings full of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine conſolation. <hi>The Lorde is with vs feare not.</hi> And another: <hi>And nowe O</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Num. 14.</note> 
               <hi>Lorde our God, ſaue vs out of the hand of Sennacherib: that all kingdomes of</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Eſa. 37.</note> 
               <hi>the earth may knowe, that thou only art God.</hi> Wherefore let vs plucke vp our hartes vnto vs, and be of good comfort for without all doubt, God wyl through all tymes, ſaue &amp; preſerue that Church, which kéepeth the doctrine, that hath bene delyuered by the Prophetes, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, and by Chriſt himſelfe, as that ſwéete promiſe in the Prophet teſtifieth:
<pb facs="tcp:3469:106"/> 
               <hi>This is my couenaunt which I wyl make</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Eſa. 59.</note> 
               <hi>with them ſayth the Lorde. My ſpirite that is vpon thee, and my vvords vvhich I haue put in thy mouth, shall not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part out of thy mouth, nor out of the mouth of thy ſeede, nor out of the mouth of the ſeede of thy ſeede, ſaieth the Lord, euen from henceforth for euermore.</hi> E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen ſo wee maye aſſure our ſelues that Chriſte wyll be preſent in our Church: ſytting at the ryght hand of his Father, and rayning in the myddle of his eni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies.</p>
            <p>But wee muſt remember, that it is our partes to thinke vpon our due<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and calling, to retaine ſtedfaſtly, the confeſſion of ſincere Doctrine, to bewtifie Gods Churche with good ende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoure, lyfe and manners. Then wyll hee not fayle vs, to pytche his Campe round about this Chriſtian Caſtell, and faithfull Fortreſſe, that no euyll thing ſhal approch nigh vnto it: he wyl be the maiſter and leader of his Sheepe, that it ſhall not bee drowned with the floodes of perſecutions. Hée wyll bleſſe this our Countrey, that it ſhall continew another <hi>Sarepta,</hi> and bee an harbour for
<pb facs="tcp:3469:106"/> his ſeruauntes. Hee wyll defende our gratious, and godlye Queene, with the cuſtodie of his holye Angelles: hee wyll adorne her Nobilytie, with pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent counſayles and happie euentes. He wyll repreſſe the ſedicious enterpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of diuelles, and wicked men: whoſe only bent and chiefe deſire is, all to rent the vnitie and concorde of his Churche, and to dyſturbe peace, and tranquilitie in Common weales. He wyll ſtyrre vp dayly, learned and faithful Paſtors, and Miniſters that ſhall fight againſt Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrie, and al erronious opinions: which Lurke and Pope mayntaine, with ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uage immanitie, and crueltie, againſt the honour of Chriſt. And finally, he wyll abandon and remoue from vs, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicious warres, perſecutions, famine, &amp; contagious diſſeaſes: that wee hauing reſtfull &amp; quiet mindes, may wholy giue our ſelues to prayer, and all other holye exerciſes, yeelding vnto him only praiſe and thankes for the myraculous pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagation, and conſeruation of his Church.</p>
